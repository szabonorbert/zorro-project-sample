# Zorro project sample
An ideal starting point of a C++ Zorro project with Visual Studio<br />

## What is Zorro?
Zorro is a free institutional-grade software tool for data collection, financial research, and algorithmic trading with C/ C++.  It's compact, portable, easy to learn, and magnitudes faster than R or Python. It does anything that automated trading platforms do - only better. Zorro offers extreme flexibility and features otherwise not found in consumer trading software. Any data analysis, visualization, or algo trading system can be realized with a small C or C++ script. R and Python machine learning libraries are also supported. More info at <https://zorro-project.com/>.

## C++
Zorro natively supports Lite-C, but it's native functions are totally supported by C++ and x64. In the Zorro help you can find a tutorial about setting up a project in Visual Studio and/or it's compiler for making Zorro softwares ("Developing Algo Trading Systems in C++"). But it's not neccessarly full documented, because there are some unmentioned gotchas you need to take care. I made this sample project to kickstart a new development, therefore you don't need to do it every time you start to work on something new.
