# Zorro project sample
An ideal starting point of a C++ Zorro project with Visual Studio<br />

## What is Zorro?
Zorro is a free institutional-grade software tool for data collection, financial research, and algorithmic trading with C/ C++.  It's compact, portable, easy to learn, and magnitudes faster than R or Python. It does anything that automated trading platforms do - only better. Zorro offers extreme flexibility and features otherwise not found in consumer trading software. Any data analysis, visualization, or algo trading system can be realized with a small C or C++ script. R and Python machine learning libraries are also supported. More info at <https://zorro-project.com/>.

## C++ and Visual Studio
Zorro's native language is "lite-C", however it's built-in functions are totally compatible with C and C++ as expected. In the Zorro help you can find a tutorial about setting up a project in Visual Studio and/or it's compiler for making Zorro softwares ("Developing Algo Trading Systems in C++"). But it's not neccessarly fully documented, because there are some unmentioned gotchas you need to take care. I made this sample project to kickstart your development, therefore you don't need to do all the setup procedure every time you start to work on something new. <br />
I use Visual Studio simply because Zorro advise to use that - but I guess it would work with any C++ compiler.
